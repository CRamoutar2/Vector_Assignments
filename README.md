# Vector_Assignments
From working on a Lab assignment in my C++ class, we had to work with vectors.
Provided is the 4 Assignments I completed.

Lab 12A (vectors.cpp):
A big benefit of vectors is their ability to be returned from functions. For this task, program a function called vector<int> makeVector(int n) that returns a vector of n integers that range from 0 to n-1. Call your program vectors.cpp. Your function must be implemented outside the main function and must return a vector.

Lab 12B (optimism.cpp):
Make a program called optimism.cpp that implements the function vector<int> goodVibes(const & vector<int> v); that, given a vector of integers, returns a vector with only the positive integers in the same order.
  
Lab 12C (fusion.cpp):
Make a program called fusion.cpp that implements the function void gogeta(vector<int> &goku, vector<int> &vegeta) that appends elements of the second vector into the first and empties the second vector
  
Lab 12D (pairwise.cpp):
Write a program called pairwise.cpp that implements the function vector<int> sumPairWise(const vector<int> &v1, const vector<int> &v2) that returns a vector of integers whose elements are the pairwise sum of the elements from the two vectors passed as arguments. If a vector has a smaller size than the other, consider extra entries from the shorter vectors as 0.
